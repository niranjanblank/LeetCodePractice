Description
In this problem, there is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array. Where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.

You need to return the number of connected components in that graph.

Example
Example 1

Input:

3
[[0,1], [0,2]]
Output:

1
Example 2

Input:

6
[[0,1], [1,2], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
Output:

2
